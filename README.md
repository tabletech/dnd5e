Parsible D&D 5th edition charts and tables.

This repo is for the keeping of digital notes related to play mechanics, as described in my copy of the 5th edition Player's Handbook. No proprietary Wizards of the Coast artistic or literary works are to be included in this repository. Where supplemental media is required, please link appropriate URIs.
